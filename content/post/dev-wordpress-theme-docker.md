I basically followed the [tutorail from Davied Yeiser](https://davidyeiser.com/tutorials/docker-wordpress-theme-setup) to set up wordpress and docker local developpment.

Now that these steps are done and you have run your docker compose with : `docker-compose up -d`

You should be able to navigate in your themes and create your thene locally.
